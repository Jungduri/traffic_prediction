Traffic Flow Predection using LSTM Networks
===========================================


#### Hello!
#### This is Jungseok's personal project git.
#### I am feel free to comment


### Data Source
The full data is available in <http://data.ex.co.kr/portal/fdwn/view?type=TCS&num=35&requestfrom=dataset>. <br />
It is too big to upload in hear. 
<br /><br />
To run this code is only need total_seoul_to_gangwon_xxx.csv. <br />
It is uploaded in "/data"


### [scr] file description. 

data_cropping_panda > data pre-process code. using pandas library. For toll estimation. <br />
data_parshing_ver3 > data pre-process code. using pandas library. For inter-toll estimation.<br />
<br />
learning_ver3 > Single toll traffic flow estimation.<br />
learning_ver4 > Inter-provincial traffic flow estimation.
